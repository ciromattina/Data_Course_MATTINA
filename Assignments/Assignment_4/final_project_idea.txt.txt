So the data that I want to work with is the location data that I collected for the research project I am doing. Right now the data I have is gps coordinates of plants that I have added envronmental factors to so that we can try and determine what makes this plant grow where it does. Hopefully I can add more data to the mix, like more in depth climate data and also soil data. 
My main goal with this project is to create an accurate map of the potential grow spots of Pediomelum, the plant I am studying. 
So a lot of the supplimentary data will be coming from world clim. That is where I will get my climate data, and hopefully I can add soil data that we have collected as well to the mix.
